# High Graphics on Android

### <cr>Disclaimer: Please download the high graphics textures from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RwM4Nm0ZoFAq0ugGS-YXCA2XPXzGB9oS?usp=sharing), unzip it and load it using Texture Loader, as Android doesn't have the high textures by default</c>

Adds support for High graphics (and Low as well if you like lol) on Android

Also adds the graphics button in the options layer so you can show your FPS in the advanced menu
