# Colored Icon Kit

## v1.0.0
- Colors all the icons in the garage, shops, achievements, etc. with your player colors.

## v1.0.1
- Fixed bug that rendered all profiles with your glow color.

## v1.0.2
- Rebuilt the mod for proper android support.

## v1.0.3
- Added `geode.node-ids` to the dependencies list.
- Fixed bug that rendered icons in your friends list and friend requests list with your glow color.
- Fixed bug that caused the colors to not update properly when pressing escape to leave the menu.

## v1.0.4
- Hopefully finally fixed the bug that renders your own glow when it shouldn't.
- Undid the fix for pressing escape in the icon kit since it broke whenever you tried to select colors multiple times.

## v1.0.5
- Fixed bug rendering glow in the icon kit regardless of if you had it enabled or not.
