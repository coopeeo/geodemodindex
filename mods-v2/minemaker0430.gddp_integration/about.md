# GDDP Integration

A mod made by Minemaker0430 that adds a new menu to the game, where you can keep track of your progression!

Complete enough levels in your current Tier and move on to the next!

**Are you worthy?**

# Important Information

If progress isn't registering, you might need to redownload the levels you've completed. This is because the mod uses your Completed Levels save data to detect how much progress you have.

If you redownloaded the levels, reopened the list, refreshed the pack menu, and still don't have the correct progress, let me know and I'll look into it.
