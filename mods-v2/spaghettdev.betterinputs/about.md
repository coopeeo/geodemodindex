# BetterInputs

The CCTextInputNode implementation Robert was too lazy to implement.

## Features

- Text selection
- Better text input™️
- Ctrl+A, Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow, Shift + Left/Right Arrow, Home, End and a bunch more hotkeys
- Esc to deselect an input node

Ya that's pretty much it for now, at least.

Keep in mind this mod is still very much in beta! Some stuff might not look right, and bugs can and will eventually happen!
If you encounter any bugs just make an issue in the GitHub repo.
