# IDS Integration

Uses the [Insane Demon Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ehtAIpCR8s04qIb8zij9sTpUdGJbmAE_LDcfVA3tcU/edit)
with [nlw-api](https://nlw.oat.zone/) to query tiers, skillsets and descriptions for all insane demons. Official fork of [NLW Integration](https://github.com/oatmealine/nlw-integration).

## About

Every insane demon placed on the spreadsheet will recieve clickable text showing its IDS tier above its demon icon. Clicking on it will show you the creators,
the tier its in, a short description blurb and if the level works in 2.2. If a level doesn't have the text, it's likely pending.

Alternatively, you can enable an option which will remove the IDS tier text, instead letting you click the demon face in order to access the same info.
