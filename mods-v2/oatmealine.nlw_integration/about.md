# NLW Integration

Uses the [Non-Listworthy Extreme Demons spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YxUE2kkvhT2E6AjnkvTf-o8iu_shSLbuFkEFcZOvieA/edit#gid=190861115)
with [nlw-api](https://nlw.oat.zone/) to query tiers, skillsets, enjoyments and descriptions for all extreme demons.

## About

Every non-listworthy extreme demon placed on the spreadsheet will recieve clickable text showing its NLW tier above its demon icon. Clicking on it will show you the creators,
the tier its in, an enjoyment rating from [EDEL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-2-n2aU__rQya_IESevHjEU0f1xbegKUZEslk7fV38Q/edit#gid=0), a short description blurb and
if the level works in 2.2. _Pending levels with not enough difficulty opinions will only recieve a range_, and sometimes no range at all if a level severely lacks opinions.

**Levels on the Demon List or projected to place on the Demon List will not have any information.**.

Alternatively, you can enable an option which will remove the NLW tier text, instead letting you click the demon face in order to access the same info.
