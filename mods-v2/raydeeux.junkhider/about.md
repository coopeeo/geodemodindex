# JunkHider

Hides various elements across several GD menus that weren't worth releasing as standalone GD mods.

Some features won't work on macOS (either due to Geode's limitations or due to Geode Team's "Node IDs" mod being unavailable on the Geode index for macOS).

For the sake of giving everyone as much freedom as possible, Geode Team's "Node IDs" mod is merely left as "suggested". It'll be an eyesore for macOS users browsing the Geode index, but that's sadly the price you pay for pouring over $1K USD (not including sales tax) onto a Macintosh computer.
