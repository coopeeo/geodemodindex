# Unix Sync

A small mod that updates ItemIDs 7501-7513 to be set to current unix, date, and time values.
This allows for events in local levels to be synced between players with triggers.

The functionality of this mod can be enabled by the creator of the level with level options.
Joining an enabled level will automatically enable the mod's functionality.
The unix timestamp in the corner of the screen can be removed via mod options.
