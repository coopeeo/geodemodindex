# Jukebox

The Jukebox Mod is a song manager for Geometry Dash. The primary goal is simplifying the process of swapping Newgrounds songs with any NONGs.

## What is a NONG, anyway?

NONG stands for **Not On NewGrounds**. Basically, it means any song that is not on Newgrounds that was replaced manually through the game files. 

NONGs have always been a hassle to manage, because some level creators use popular Newgrounds song IDs and replace them with a NONG. So you have to swap those song files around quite a bit if you play a level with the Newgrounds song and a level with a NONG song.

## Start your jukebox!

The Jukebox Mod makes the process of managing your songs a breeze. You can download your NONGs using your method of choice. My recommandations are: [Cobalt](https://cobalt.tools/) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), a CLI application. After getting your MP3 file, you can enter a song and author name, for easier management.

> Note that Jukebox copies imported MP3 files in the storage location designated by Geode. You can open this folder from ingame.

Alternatively, you can download songs from **Song File Hub**. I have added a button that opens their site in your browser.

## So, how do I begin?

You can open up the Jukebox menu form any Level page. Just click on the song name, and either a song list (if the level has multiple songs), or the song management screen (if the level only uses 1 song) will open. From here, you can add, remove and swap songs.
