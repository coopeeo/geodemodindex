# Jumpscare

Randomly jumpscares you when you die

My **attempt** at recreating MegaHack's Jumpscare module

You can change the **behavior** of the mod in the mod settings

To change the **textures and sound** of the jumpscare, press the pencil button next to the mod settings button

(**You must restart the game for the change to take place**!)

## Special thanks to CatXus for testing this mod on Android for me :D


<!-- **For Android:** The pencil button doesn't currently work, please manually go to `/storage/0/Android/media/com.geode.launcher/game/geode/config/weebify.jumpscare` -->
