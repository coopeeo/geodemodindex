# Brightness Mod
A new button is added to the editor, you can edit the brightness of objects automatically using parameters (minimum brightness, maximum brightness and a random value with which you can make a "noise" effect)

# How to use:
Select 1 or more objects and press the button, this will automatically assign them a brightness value depending on the height, if you have the option "radial" or "lineal" it will also take the width.

In the Brightness options you can configure if you want it to affect only the base color, detail or both

# How to open the options menu:
If you do not have any object selected, you can simply press the button and the options will open, but if you have an object selected you can press and hold the button for a moment to open the options.
